    <p>The Mau Mau (origin of the name is uncertain) advocated violent resistance to British domination in Kenya; the movement was especially associated with the ritual oaths employed by leaders of the Kikuyu Central Association to promote unity in the independence movement.23 Aug 2024</p>
    <p>How cache memory work with CPU. 
        When CPU needs the data, first of all, it looks inside the L1 cache. If it does not find 
        anything in L1, it looks inside the L2 cache. If again, it does not find the data in L2 cache, 
        it looks into the L3 cache. If data is found in the cache memory, then it is known as a cache 
        hit. On the contrary, if data is not found inside the cache, it is called a cache miss. 
        If data is not available < href=""></href>in any of the cache memories, it looks inside the Random Access 
        Memory (RAM). If RAM also does not have the data, then it will get that data from the  
        Hard Disk Drive. 
        So, when a computer is started for the first time, or an application is opened for the first 
        time, data is not available in cache memory or in RAM. In this case, the CPU gets the data 
        directly from the hard disk drive. Thereafter, when you start your computer or open an 
        application, CPU can get that data from cache memory or RAM.</p>
